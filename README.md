# Form Builder Examples

This repository is a collection of examples to help you get started with form builder. 

## [Production docker build](./production-docker)

For deploying one or multiple form JSONs which should not be editable once deployed.

## [Save and return](./save-and-return)

Saving form data and allowing users to return to the form at a later date. This example also includes a runner build with forms to test with.
Use this code to help you understand the workflow, and how everything works together. It is not production ready code, and does not persist data to a database (only in memory!)
